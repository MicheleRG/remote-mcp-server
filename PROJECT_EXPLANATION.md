# Project Summary

## Purpose

This project implements a remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server running on Cloudflare Workers. It aims to expose tools (e.g., an "add" function) that MCP clients like Claude Desktop or the MCP Inspector can call. The server incorporates an OAuth 2.0 provider flow to manage authorization for accessing these tools.

## Architecture

The project is built upon the following key components:

1.  **Cloudflare Workers:** A serverless platform hosting the MCP server and OAuth provider. This enables global distribution and scalability for the application.
2.  **Hono:** A lightweight and fast web framework used to build HTTP API endpoints. It specifically handles the OAuth authorization flow (e.g., `/authorize`, `/approve`) and serves a basic homepage.
3.  **MCP SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`):** This library is instrumental in creating and managing the MCP server (`McpServer`). It also defines the tools that MCP clients can interact with. The project utilizes a custom `McpAgent` (named `MyMCP`) to initialize these tools.
4.  **Cloudflare Workers OAuth Provider (`@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`):** This library implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow. Its responsibilities include parsing authorization requests, managing client registration (though not fully implemented in this demonstration), and issuing tokens after successful authorization.
5.  **TypeScript:** The entire project is developed in TypeScript, which offers static typing to enhance code quality and maintainability.
6.  **Node.js/npm:** These are used for managing project dependencies (via `package.json`) and executing development scripts, such as running a local server or deploying the application.

## Overall Flow

The interaction within the system follows this general sequence:

1.  An MCP client (e.g., Claude, MCP Inspector) initiates a connection attempt to the server's MCP endpoint, typically `/sse`.
2.  The `OAuthProvider` intercepts this request. If the client is not already authorized, it triggers an OAuth flow.
3.  The user is redirected to an authorization page (e.g., `/authorize`) served by the Hono application.
4.  The user performs a "login" (which is a mock login in this demonstration) and approves the requested scopes.
5.  Upon approval (usually via an endpoint like `/approve`), the `OAuthProvider` finalizes the authorization process. This allows the MCP client to connect and utilize the defined tools (such as the `add` tool).
6.  The `McpAgent` is then responsible for handling tool calls originating from the authorized client.

# Detailed Project Explanation

This document details the purpose and functionality of key files within the remote MCP server project.

## `src/index.ts`

**Main Responsibilities:**

*   **Entry Point:** This file serves as the primary entry point for the Cloudflare Worker.
*   **MCP Server Initialization:** It defines and initializes the `MyMCP` class, which extends `McpAgent`. This class is responsible for setting up the `McpServer` instance from the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
*   **Tool Definition:** Within the `MyMCP.init()` method, it defines the tools that will be available to MCP clients. In this specific example, an "add" tool is defined, which takes two numbers as input (validated using `zod`) and returns their sum.
*   **OAuth Integration:** It instantiates the `OAuthProvider` from `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`. This is crucial for handling the OAuth 2.0 flow.
*   **Request Handling Orchestration:** The `OAuthProvider` is configured with:
    *   `apiRoute: "/sse"`: Specifies the path for the MCP server's Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint.
    *   `apiHandler: MyMCP.mount("/sse")`: Mounts the `MyMCP` agent to handle requests on the `/sse` path, meaning any MCP communication will go through this handler after successful OAuth.
    *   `defaultHandler: app`: Delegates all other HTTP requests (not handled by the `apiRoute` or OAuth specific endpoints) to the Hono application defined in `src/app.ts`.
    *   OAuth endpoints (`authorizeEndpoint`, `tokenEndpoint`, `clientRegistrationEndpoint`): Defines the paths for the standard OAuth 2.0 endpoints.

**Contribution to Project:**

`src/index.ts` is the core of the worker. It ties together the MCP functionality with the OAuth authorization layer. It ensures that access to the MCP tools is protected by OAuth and delegates web UI and other HTTP handling to the Hono app.

## `src/app.ts`

**Main Responsibilities:**

*   **Web Application Framework:** This file utilizes the Hono web framework to create and manage HTTP routes for the user-facing parts of the OAuth flow and a basic homepage.
*   **Routing:**
    *   `GET /`: Serves a basic homepage. The content for this page is fetched from `README.md` (via `utils.ts`) and rendered within a standard layout.
    *   `GET /authorize`: Renders the authorization page. It checks a mock "isLoggedIn" status and displays either a form to approve scopes (if "logged in") or a form to "log in" and approve scopes (if "not logged in"). It uses `c.env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.parseAuthRequest` to get details about the authorization request.
    *   `POST /approve`: Handles the form submission from the `/authorize` page. It parses the form body (using `parseApproveFormBody` from `utils.ts`), performs a mock validation for login (if applicable), and then calls `c.env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.completeAuthorization` to finalize the OAuth grant if the user approves. It then renders an "approved" or "rejected" status page.
*   **Type Definitions:** Defines `Bindings` type, which extends `Env` (Cloudflare environment variables) and includes `OAUTH_PROVIDER` (OAuth helper utilities).
*   **HTML Rendering:** Uses utility functions from `src/utils.ts` (like `layout`, `renderLoggedInAuthorizeScreen`, etc.) to generate and return HTML content for the different routes.

**Contribution to Project:**

`src/app.ts` provides the necessary web interface for the user to interact with the OAuth 2.0 authorization process. It guides the user through granting or denying permissions to the MCP client application.

## `src/utils.ts`

**Main Responsibilities:**

*   **HTML Templating/Layout:** Provides a `layout` function that defines the basic HTML structure (doctype, head, body, header, footer, Tailwind CSS setup) for all web pages. This ensures a consistent look and feel.
*   **Content Rendering Functions:** Contains several functions dedicated to rendering specific pieces of HTML content:
    *   `homeContent`: Fetches the `README.md` file (symlinked into static assets) and renders it as HTML using the `marked` library.
    *   `renderLoggedInAuthorizeScreen`: Generates the HTML for the authorization screen when the user is considered already logged in.
    *   `renderLoggedOutAuthorizeScreen`: Generates the HTML for the authorization screen when the user needs to "log in".
    *   `renderAuthorizationApprovedContent`: Renders the success page after authorization is approved.
    *   `renderAuthorizationRejectedContent`: Renders the page shown when authorization is rejected (though not explicitly used in the current `/approve` logic for rejection, the function exists).
    *   `renderApproveContent`: A generic helper for rendering approval/rejection status pages with a message, status indicator, and redirect.
*   **Form Parsing:**
    *   `parseApproveFormBody`: Extracts data from the form submitted to `/approve` (action, OAuth request info, email, password). It also handles parsing the `oauthReqInfo` JSON string.
*   **Styling:** Includes basic CSS and Tailwind CSS configuration directly within the `layout` function for styling the HTML pages.

**Contribution to Project:**

`src/utils.ts` primarily serves to keep the main application logic in `src/app.ts` cleaner by abstracting away the details of HTML generation and form data parsing. It promotes reusability of common UI elements and structures. The comment at the top rightly states it's a "dumping ground for uninteresting html and CSS".

## `wrangler.jsonc`

**Main Responsibilities:**

*   **Cloudflare Worker Configuration:** This is the configuration file for Wrangler, the command-line tool for building and deploying Cloudflare Workers.
*   **Worker Definition:**
    *   `name`: "remote-mcp-server" - Defines the name of the worker.
    *   `main`: "src/index.ts" - Specifies the entry point file for the worker.
    *   `compatibility_date`: "2025-03-10" - Sets the compatibility date, ensuring consistent behavior with Cloudflare's runtime features as of that date.
    *   `compatibility_flags`: `["nodejs_compat"]` - Enables Node.js compatibility features.
*   **Migrations:** Defines database migrations, specifically for SQLite, indicating that the `MyMCP` class uses new SQLite features.
*   **Durable Objects:**
    *   `bindings`: Configures bindings for Durable Objects. It maps the class `MyMCP` to a Durable Object named `MCP_OBJECT`. This is essential for the MCP server's stateful operations if `MyMCP` were to be used as a Durable Object directly in certain architectures (though the current `OAuthProvider` setup uses it as a handler).
*   **KV Namespaces:**
    *   `bindings`: Configures bindings for Workers KV (Key-Value store). It binds a KV namespace with ID `e9364150cdd94c239782ccce51d73a96` to the variable `OAUTH_KV`. This KV namespace is likely used by `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` to store OAuth-related data (e.g., tokens, authorization codes).
*   **Observability:**
    *   `enabled: true` - Enables observability features for the worker.
*   **Static Assets:**
    *   `assets`: Configures serving static assets. It specifies that files from the `./static/` directory should be served and binds these assets to the `ASSETS` service binding, allowing the worker to fetch them (as seen in `homeContent` in `utils.ts` for `README.md`).

**Contribution to Project:**

`wrangler.jsonc` is critical for deploying and running the application on Cloudflare. It tells Cloudflare how to build the worker, what resources (like Durable Objects and KV namespaces) it needs, and how to serve associated static files.

## `package.json`

**Main Responsibilities:**

*   **Project Metadata:**
    *   `name`: "remote-mcp-server" - The name of the package.
    *   `version`: "0.0.0" - The current version of the package.
    *   `private`: true - Indicates that this package is not intended to be published to a public registry.
*   **Scripts:** Defines various command-line scripts for common development tasks:
    *   `deploy`: "wrangler deploy" - Deploys the worker to Cloudflare.
    *   `dev`: "wrangler dev" - Runs the worker locally for development.
    *   `format`: "biome format --write" - Formats the code using Biome.
    *   `lint:fix`: "biome lint --fix" - Lints the code and automatically fixes issues using Biome.
    *   `start`: "wrangler dev" - An alias for `dev`.
    *   `cf-typegen`: "wrangler types" - Generates TypeScript types for Cloudflare bindings.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   `devDependencies`: Lists packages needed for development but not for runtime in production. This includes:
        *   `marked`: For converting Markdown to HTML (used for the README on the homepage).
        *   `typescript`: The TypeScript compiler.
        *   `workers-mcp`: Likely related to MCP development or tooling for workers (version seems specific).
        *   `wrangler`: The Cloudflare CLI tool.
    *   `dependencies`: Lists packages required for the application to run. This includes:
        *   `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`: The library for implementing the OAuth 2.0 provider.
        *   `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: The Model Context Protocol SDK for creating the MCP server and tools.
        *   `agents`: A generic "agents" library, potentially providing the base `McpAgent` class or related utilities.
        *   `hono`: The web framework used for routing and handling HTTP requests.
        *   `zod`: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, used here for validating tool input.

**Contribution to Project:**

`package.json` is the standard Node.js manifest file. It's essential for managing the project's dependencies, defining development workflows (scripts), and providing basic information about the project. It allows developers to easily install necessary packages and run common tasks.

## Development and Deployment Process

This section outlines how to develop the project locally and deploy it to Cloudflare.

### Local Development

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:cloudflare/ai.git`
    *   Navigate to the `ai` directory: `cd ai`
    *   Install dependencies using npm: `npm install`
    *(Note: The `README.md` implies these commands are run from the parent `ai` directory, and `package.json` is for the `remote-mcp-server` project specifically. Dependencies for this specific project are installed as part of the broader `npm install` in the `ai` directory if it's a monorepo structure, or via `npm install` directly in the `remote-mcp-server` directory if it's standalone).*

2.  **Run Locally:**
    *   The command to run the server locally is `npx nx dev remote-mcp-server` (from the `ai` directory as per `README.md`) or `wrangler dev` / `npm run dev` / `npm start` (from the project directory, as per `package.json` scripts). The `README.md` likely refers to a command in a parent monorepo context.
    *   The server will typically be available at: `http://localhost:8787/`

### Deployment to Cloudflare

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Create a KV namespace for OAuth data: `npx wrangler kv namespace create OAUTH_KV`
    *   After running this command, Wrangler will provide an `id`. This `id` must be added to the `wrangler.jsonc` file under `kv_namespaces` for the `OAUTH_KV` binding. For example:
        ```jsonc
        // wrangler.jsonc
        {
          // ... other configurations
          "kv_namespaces": [
            {
              "binding": "OAUTH_KV",
              "id": "YOUR_NEWLY_CREATED_KV_NAMESPACE_ID" // Replace with actual ID
            }
          ]
          // ... other configurations
        }
        ```

2.  **Deploy:**
    *   The command to deploy the application to Cloudflare is: `npm run deploy` (which executes `wrangler deploy` as defined in `package.json`).

This information is primarily sourced from the project's `README.md` and `package.json` files.

## Testing and Using the MCP Server

This section describes how to test and use the MCP server with the MCP Inspector and Claude Desktop, for both local development and deployed instances.

### Using the MCP Inspector

The MCP Inspector is a tool to explore and interact with MCP APIs.

1.  **Start the MCP Inspector:**
    *   Run the command: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`
    *   For the deployed server, use the latest version: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@latest`

2.  **Connect to the Local Server:**
    *   Open the MCP Inspector (usually at `http://localhost:5173`).
    *   Set **Transport Type** to `SSE`.
    *   Set **URL** to `http://localhost:8787/sse`.
    *   Click "Connect".

3.  **Connect to the Deployed Server:**
    *   Open the MCP Inspector.
    *   Set **Transport Type** to `SSE`.
    *   Set **URL** to your Cloudflare Worker's `.workers.dev` URL, followed by `/sse` (e.g., `your-worker-name.your-account-name.workers.dev/sse`).
    *   Click "Connect".

4.  **Mock Login Process:**
    *   After clicking "Connect", you will be redirected to a mock user/password login screen (served by the MCP server's Hono app).
    *   Enter any email and password to "log in".
    *   You should be redirected back to the MCP Inspector.

5.  **Interacting with Tools:**
    *   Once connected and "logged in", you can list and call any tools defined on the MCP server (e.g., the "add" tool).

### Connecting with Claude Desktop

You can also integrate the MCP server with Claude Desktop.

1.  **Anthropic's Quickstart:**
    *   Follow [Anthropic's Quickstart guide](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) for initial setup with Claude Desktop and MCP.

2.  **Configuration for Local Server:**
    *   In Claude Desktop, go to `Settings > Developer > Edit Config` to open your configuration file.
    *   Replace the file content with the following, which runs a local proxy (`mcp-remote`) to connect Claude to your local server:
        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "math": {
              "command": "npx",
              "args": [
                "mcp-remote",
                "http://localhost:8787/sse"
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```

3.  **Configuration for Deployed Server:**
    *   Update the Claude Desktop configuration file to point to your deployed Worker's URL:
        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "math": {
              "command": "npx",
              "args": [
                "mcp-remote",
                "https://your-worker-name.your-account-name.workers.dev/sse" // Replace with your actual URL
              ]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    *   Restart Claude Desktop after updating the configuration.

4.  **Verifying Tool Availability:**
    *   When you open Claude Desktop after configuration:
        *   A browser window should open for the mock login process.
        *   After successful login, you should see the available tools (e.g., "math" tool with its "add" function) in the bottom right of the Claude interface (often indicated by a hammer icon).
        *   You can then prompt Claude to use the tool (e.g., "Could you use the math tool to add 23 and 19?").

### Debugging Tips (from `README.md`)

*   **Restart Claude:** If issues occur, try restarting Claude Desktop.
*   **Direct Connection Test:** Test direct connection to the MCP server using the command line:
    `npx mcp-remote http://localhost:8787/sse` (for local) or your deployed URL.
*   **Clear MCP Auth Cache:** In rare cases, clearing files from `~/.mcp-auth` might help:
    `rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth`

This information is primarily extracted from the `README.md` file.

## OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flow

The project implements an OAuth 2.0 authorization flow to protect the MCP server and its tools. This flow is handled by the `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` library in conjunction with the Hono application for user interaction.

**Key Characteristics:**

*   **Authorization Code Grant Type (implied):** Although not explicitly stated, the flow described (redirection to an authorization server, user consent, and redirection back with a code that would then be exchanged for a token) is characteristic of the Authorization Code Grant type, which is a common and secure OAuth 2.0 flow.
*   **Mock User Authentication:** The current implementation features a **mock login system**. For demonstration purposes, it does not integrate with a real identity provider or user database. Any email/password is accepted when the "login\_approve" action is triggered.

**Flow Steps:**

1.  **Initiation (Client Request to Protected Resource):**
    *   The flow typically begins when an MCP client (e.g., MCP Inspector, Claude Desktop) attempts to access a protected resource, which is the MCP SSE endpoint at `/sse`.
    *   The `OAuthProvider` (configured in `src/index.ts`) intercepts requests to this `apiRoute`.
    *   If the client does not present a valid access token (or has no token), the `OAuthProvider` determines that authorization is required.

2.  **Redirection to Authorization Endpoint (`/authorize`):**
    *   The `OAuthProvider` redirects the user's browser (or the client application, which then opens a browser) to the `/authorize` endpoint. This endpoint is handled by the Hono app (`src/app.ts`).
    *   The `GET /authorize` route handler in `src/app.ts` is responsible for presenting the authorization request to the user.
    *   It calls `c.env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.parseAuthRequest(c.req.raw)` to get details about the incoming OAuth request (e.g., client ID, requested scopes, redirect URI).
    *   **User State Handling (Mocked):**
        *   The code includes a hardcoded `isLoggedIn` boolean (defaulting to `true`).
        *   If `isLoggedIn` is `true`, it renders `renderLoggedInAuthorizeScreen` (from `src/utils.ts`), which shows a form to approve or reject the requested scopes for the pre-determined user (`user@example.com`).
        *   If `isLoggedIn` were `false`, it would render `renderLoggedOutAuthorizeScreen`, which includes fields for email and password along with the scope approval options.
    *   **Scope Presentation:** The defined `oauthScopes` (e.g., "read\_profile", "read\_data") are displayed to the user, informing them of the permissions the client application is requesting.

3.  **User Consent and Submission to Approval Endpoint (`/approve`):**
    *   The user interacts with the form on the `/authorize` page. They can choose to:
        *   "Approve" the request (if "logged in").
        *   "Log in and Approve" (if "logged out", requiring them to fill in mock credentials).
        *   "Reject" the request.
    *   The form `POST`s to the `/approve` endpoint, also handled by the Hono app.
    *   The `POST /approve` route handler in `src/app.ts`:
        *   Parses the form body using `parseApproveFormBody` (from `src/utils.ts`) to get the user's action, the original `oauthReqInfo`, and any submitted credentials (email, password).
        *   **Mock Login Validation:** If the `action` is "login\_approve", it checks if the (mock) login should be considered valid. In the current code, this validation is hardcoded to always pass (`if (false)` for the rejection path). A real implementation would validate credentials here.
        *   **Completing Authorization:** If the user approves (and the mock login is successful), it calls `c.env.OAUTH_PROVIDER.completeAuthorization()`. This function from the `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` library is crucial. It takes the `oauthReqInfo`, a `userId` (the email from the form), metadata, the approved `scope`, and other properties.
        *   The `completeAuthorization` method handles the OAuth mechanics:
            *   It likely generates an authorization code (if following the full Authorization Code Grant).
            *   It then redirects the user back to the client's registered `redirect_uri` with the authorization code (or directly issues tokens if using a simplified flow, though less common for this setup). The `redirectTo` variable from its result is used for this.
        *   Finally, it renders an "Authorization approved!" page (`renderAuthorizationApprovedContent`) which then automatically redirects the user's browser to the `redirectTo` URL.

4.  **Token Exchange (Implicitly handled by `OAuthProvider` and Client):**
    *   **Token Endpoint (`/token`):** Although `src/app.ts` doesn't explicitly implement the `/token` endpoint's logic, `src/index.ts` configures the `OAuthProvider` with `tokenEndpoint: "/token"`. The `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` library would internally handle requests to this endpoint.
    *   In a standard Authorization Code Grant, the client application (after receiving the authorization code at its `redirect_uri`) would make a backend request to this `/token` endpoint, exchanging the authorization code (and client credentials) for an access token and optionally a refresh token.
    *   The MCP clients like Inspector or the `mcp-remote` proxy used by Claude Desktop would handle this token exchange process under the hood after the redirect from `/approve`.

5.  **Accessing Protected Resource with Token:**
    *   Once the MCP client has obtained an access token, it includes this token in subsequent requests to the protected `/sse` endpoint.
    *   The `OAuthProvider` (in `src/index.ts`) validates this token. If valid, it allows the request to proceed to the `apiHandler: MyMCP.mount("/sse")`, granting access to the MCP tools.

6.  **Client Registration Endpoint (`/register`):**
    *   `src/index.ts` also defines `clientRegistrationEndpoint: "/register"`.
    *   This endpoint would typically be used for dynamic client registration, where client applications can register themselves with the OAuth provider. This is not detailed in `src/app.ts` and might be a placeholder or a feature intended for future development.

**In summary, the project uses `@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider` to manage most of the OAuth 2.0 mechanics, while `src/app.ts` (Hono) provides the necessary user interface for the authorization step, including a mock login.** The flow ensures that MCP clients are authorized by the user before they can access the defined tools.

## Potential Improvements and Further Development

Based on the current project structure and common software engineering practices, here are several areas for potential improvement and future development:

1.  **Real Authentication and User Management:**
    *   **Replace Mock Login:** The most significant improvement would be to replace the current mock login system in `src/app.ts` with a genuine authentication mechanism. This could involve:
        *   Integrating with a third-party identity provider (IdP) like Auth0, Okta, or Cloudflare Access using standards like OpenID Connect (OIDC).
        *   Implementing a user database (e.g., using Cloudflare D1 or another database solution) to store user credentials securely, along with password hashing and management features.
    *   **User Context:** Pass authenticated user information to the `MyMCP` agent, allowing tools to act on behalf of a specific user or access user-specific data.

2.  **Expand MCP Toolset:**
    *   **More Complex Tools:** Develop and integrate more sophisticated tools beyond the simple `add` function. These tools could interact with other APIs, databases, or perform more complex computations.
    *   **Varied Tool Types:** Explore different types of tool interactions, such as tools that stream data, require multiple steps, or manage state.
    *   **Dynamic Tool Loading:** Consider mechanisms for dynamically loading or registering tools, perhaps based on user permissions or configurations.

3.  **Enhanced Error Handling:**
    *   **OAuth Flow Errors:** Implement more robust error handling within the Hono app (`src/app.ts`) for the OAuth flow. This includes providing user-friendly error pages or messages for scenarios like invalid client requests, authentication failures (once real auth is in place), or issues during token issuance.
    *   **MCP Tool Errors:** Standardize error responses from MCP tools. Ensure that errors are caught and propagated back to the MCP client in a structured format.
    *   **Logging and Monitoring:** Integrate more comprehensive logging throughout the application (e.g., using Cloudflare's Logpush or third-party logging services) to aid in debugging and monitoring. The `observability: { enabled: true }` in `wrangler.jsonc` is a good start.

4.  **Full Client Registration Implementation:**
    *   **Develop `/register` Endpoint:** Fully implement the client registration endpoint (`/register` defined in `src/index.ts`). This would allow MCP client applications to dynamically register with the OAuth provider, rather than relying on pre-configured client details.
    *   **Client Credential Management:** Securely manage client credentials (e.g., client secrets) if implementing confidential clients.

5.  **Robust OAuth Data Storage (KV Store Usage):**
    *   **Refresh Tokens:** If implementing refresh tokens for long-lived access, ensure they are securely stored (e.g., in the `OAUTH_KV` namespace) and managed appropriately (e.g., with proper expiry and revocation mechanisms).
    *   **Authorization Codes:** Ensure authorization codes are short-lived and securely managed in the KV store.
    *   **Client Configuration Store:** Potentially store dynamic client configurations or other OAuth-related metadata in KV if not using a full database for such purposes.

6.  **Customization and Configuration:**
    *   **Granular Scopes and Permissions:** Allow for more detailed definition and management of OAuth scopes. Implement a system where client applications can be granted specific permissions, and users can consent to these granularly.
    *   **Configuration Management:** Externalize more configuration settings (e.g., mock login behavior, default scopes, token lifespans) instead of hardcoding them, possibly using environment variables or a configuration file.

7.  **Automated Testing:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for individual components, especially:
        *   Hono route handlers in `src/app.ts` (mocking `c.env.OAUTH_PROVIDER` and other external dependencies).
        *   Utility functions in `src/utils.ts`.
        *   MCP tool logic within `MyMCP` in `src/index.ts`.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Develop integration tests to verify the interaction between different parts of the system:
        *   Test the full OAuth flow by simulating client requests and user interactions.
        *   Test the interaction between the OAuth provider and the MCP server.
    *   **End-to-End Tests (Optional but Recommended):** Simulate an MCP client connecting and calling a tool through the entire OAuth-protected stack.

8.  **Security Hardening:**
    *   **Input Validation:** While `zod` is used for tool inputs, ensure all external inputs (HTTP headers, query parameters, request bodies in `src/app.ts`) are rigorously validated.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints like `/approve`, `/token`, and `/register` to protect against abuse.
    *   **Security Headers:** Add standard security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) to responses from the Hono app.
    *   **CSRF Protection:** Ensure forms in the Hono app are protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) if they involve state-changing operations initiated by user sessions.

9.  **Documentation and Code Clarity:**
    *   **Inline Comments:** Add more inline comments to explain complex logic, especially within the OAuth interactions and MCP agent.
    *   **Type Safety:** Address the `// @ts-ignore` comments in `src/index.ts` by finding or defining appropriate types to improve type safety.
    *   **README Enhancements:** Keep the `README.md` updated with any new features, setup steps, or architectural changes.

These improvements would contribute to a more robust, secure, and feature-rich remote MCP server.
